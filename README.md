# 20-Minute-Game
This code is a Python script using Pygame to create a simple game called "Chasing Squares." Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:

Imports: The code begins with importing the necessary libraries, pygame, random, and math.

Pygame Initialization: Pygame is initialized using pygame.init(), and the screen size is set up with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 600 pixels.

Background: The background image is loaded and scaled to fit the screen.

Colors: Constants for various colors are defined using RGB values.

Player Attributes: Attributes such as size, initial position, and speed of the player square are defined.

Enemy Attributes: Attributes for the enemy squares are defined, including size, speed, and spawning parameters.

Acid Blotch Attributes: Attributes for acid blots (harmful obstacles) are defined.

Game Variables: Variables like running, game_over, score, and grace_active are initialized.

Special Enemy Attributes: Attributes for a special enemy with unique behaviors are defined, including size, speed, and dash mechanics.

Power-Up Attributes: Attributes for power-ups are defined, including spawn rate and duration.

Enemy Creation Functions: Functions to create enemies in circular formations with holes from the edges are defined.

Special Enemy Class: A class for the special enemy is defined, including methods for movement and dashing.

Shooting Enemy Class: A class for an enemy that shoots projectiles towards the player is defined, including methods for movement and shooting.

Distance Calculation Function: A function to calculate the distance between two points is defined using the Euclidean distance formula.

Text Drawing Function: A function to display text on the screen is defined.

Special Enemy Update Function: A function to update special enemies' behavior, including their dashing mechanism, is defined.

Main Game Loop: The main game loop where the game logic and rendering occur.

Event Handling: Handling of user events such as quitting the game or restarting it.

Player Movement: Updating the player's position based on user input.

Enemy Spawning and Movement: Spawning and moving regular enemies and special enemies.

Acid Blotch Spawning: Spawning acid blots randomly on the screen.

Collision Detection: Checking for collisions between the player and enemies, special enemies, and acid blots.

Drawing: Rendering all the game elements on the screen.

Frame Rate Control: Limiting the frame rate to 60 frames per second.

Quit Pygame: Closing Pygame when the game loop exits.

This code provides a foundation for a simple game where the player avoids enemies and obstacles while trying to survive as long as possible and score points. You can continue building upon this code by adding more features, levels, and enhancements to make the game more engaging and challenging.
